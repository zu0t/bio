        <p><b>Who is zuot?</b><br>
            Hi, I'm zuot. I was born and currently live in Czechia, and I'm 17 years old. I do web development. Although I used to enjoy it, due to an incident that happened, I'm no longer as passionate about it as I once was.</p>            
        <p><b>MY favorite games</b><br>
            Right now, I don't have any favorite game. I don't really play games that much; I no longer enjoy them. Sometimes I play Roblox, sometimes I play CS2. It depends...</p>
        <p><b>My Favorite Songs and Artist</b><br> 
            I usually don't like talking about my music taste and playlist because people make fun of it, but my favorite song right now is <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DevwFKEFrfo">"Ghost" by BoyWithUke</a></b>, and my favorite artist is <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA3PLfFMuT963D-qGVjAFaw">BoyWithUke</a></b>.</p>
        <p><b>My favorite content creators</b><br>
            I really enjoy watching YouTube and Twitch. My favorite YouTuber is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Plainrock124"><b>Plainrock124</b></a>, who is a tech destruction YouTuber. I like his humor and the type of videos he makes.<br>My favorite streamer is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/agraelus"><b>Agraelus</b></a>. He's a Czech streamer who started on YouTube and then moved to Twitch. I really like his humor and the games he plays.</p>
