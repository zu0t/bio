When i was 13 I got my first pc (because my brother got pc at the same age and covid started). I also around the time started uploading on tiktok with getting around 100k views. In 2022 I started "cheating" in roblox, with buying SynapseX. In november 2022 I got banned from SynapseX discord server. After a month I joined Sirius discord and my discord life changed. I started getting more into IT things and found out about selfbots and image hosts.

I really liked the idea of using one, but it was too expensive for me and I didn't want to spent 30 dollars for a selfbot. But my best (online) friend got me it. I started making some custom commands and scripts for it and slowly learned discord.py (discord.py > discord.js).

I used to like rammstein, but my song preferances changed when i found BoyWithUke on tiktok and listened to his songs. If you want to see my playlist, then fuck you I ain't showing it to you, but from this article u can imagine how would it looked.<br><br>

                                My first cheating expirience started on phone. I used some minecraft cheating mod on google play store that worked in online too. I used to just use killaura and scaffold xd. I was just flying over the map on hive and mineplex with ass anticheat. I used to download mod menus for games like prophunt portable and similar games like this. It was so fun just being bigger than everyone. When I first got pc My first game that I bought was minecraft. And ofc I started cheating there. I used client called Sigma (like me im sigma 🔥🔥🔥). This client was for free with premium that cost 20 euro. Sadly sigma exit scam 2 years ago. So I had to switch... For while I used luiquidbounce and some cracks of other paid cheats, but it wasn't it. I didn't want so spent any money for cheat clients so I stopped. After few months, I started getting interested in roblox exploiting, so I got SynapseX and started cheating in PhantomForces (eventually getting banned) I cheated in roblox for over a year, until roblox added their anticheat and I couldn't cheat anymore. So I stopped and I don't cheat anymore.

                                 I was banned many times. The most recent ban was in fortnite. I got banned, because some program was running in my background and EAC detected it as a cheat driver. But this ban actually helped me, cuz im no more getting frustrated by playing this game. I got banned in other games too, like when i still didn't have pc, I used to play critical ops on my phone. One time I got 1 hour ban. I don't remember what it was, but probably cuz i was good 😎. Also I got banned on many minecraft servers but mainly with warez accounts, cuz I was cheating lmao. Also I was banned from survivalgames.cz for cheating. Yeah I was cheating, but eventually I got unbanned. Irl i'm banned only in one supermarket, but they forgot about it, so I can go inside.
